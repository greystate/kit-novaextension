# Kit Extension for Nova

This extension contains clips for variables and includes/imports,
along with a crude Language Definition for the [Kit language][KIT] that allows
for some syntax highlighting.

> [!NOTE]
> Due to Nova 13 having deprecated setting a parent language for new syntax,
> I've rebuilt this using Nova 12's HTML syntax file as a starting point,
> which is good enough for my use-case.
